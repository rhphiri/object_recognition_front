Website that recognizes objects in a picture

This repository contains React files for a website that recognizes objects in a picture.

New users are required to create an account and register their details in order to use the website.

Once they have an account, they can login and enter the url to an image they want analysed in the search bar provided.

The website will then communicate with an artificial intelligence called Clarifai via a server. Clarifai will analyse the image provided and will send back information which will then be displayed on the website. Clarifai will name all the main objects that it has recognised in the image.
